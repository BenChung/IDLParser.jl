# ── export_typesupport: write a discovered type into durable form ────────────
# Writes a registered type to disk in one of three formats (§11): `:msg`
# (interface-package layout from `IL.unparse`), `:julia` (`generate_code` output
# as static `.jl` source), and `:typedesc` (the raw wire blob, language-agnostic).
# RIHS01 is the roundtrip invariant across all three.

    export_typesupport(node_or_ctx, names; to=pwd(), format=:msg) -> Vector{String}

Write registered (typically discovered) types out of the in-memory registry
into durable, user-owned files (§11), returning the paths written. `names` is a
single type name or any iterable of names; `format` selects the layout (the
ROS 2 interface concept:
https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Concepts/Basic/About-Interfaces.html):

- `:msg` (default) / `:julia_text` — `IL.unparse` the type into ROS interface
  text at `<to>/<package>/<qualifier>/<Name>.<ext>` (`.msg` / `.srv` /
  `.action` per the IL kind). The most portable form: `colcon build` turns the
  tree into a real interface package. A discovered type's text carries exactly
  the field definitions RIHS01 covers, so it is wire-faithful; constants and
  defaults are absent (`lift` drops them), so it is lossy as documentation.
- `:julia` — emit `Generation.generate_code`'s output as `.jl` source at
  `<to>/<package>.jl` (or `<to>/<Name>.jl` for a package-less name) to check in
  and `include`. The strongest port-forward: the once-dynamic type becomes
  static, precompilable, and back on the min-copy fast path. The file carries
  inline `import StaticArrays, CDRSerialization` so it reparses standalone. This
  emits the entry's own IL only; a self-contained type loads as written, while a
  type with nested cross-package fields needs its referenced types exported
  alongside it (the closure), which this single-type path leaves out.
- `:typedesc` — the raw wire `TypeDescription` JSON bundle at
  `<to>/<Name>.typedesc.json`; language-agnostic and reloadable by ROSNode.

Throws `ArgumentError` when a requested name is not registered (discover or
[`load_ament_type`](@ref) it first), when an unknown `format` is given, or when
`:typedesc` is requested for an `:ament`-acquired entry — one parsed from local
interface text, which carries no wire `TypeDescription`. The `:wire`, `:cache`,
`:static`, and `:authored` entries all carry one and export as `:typedesc`
fine. Name resolution ignores the hash version — the first registry entry
matching the name is exported.
