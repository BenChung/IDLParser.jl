# The write-once result cell and fail-safe settlement (§8 services, §9 actions).
#
# A client always blocks on the result, so a handler has *no non-terminal exit*:
# every exit fills the cell exactly once before the task is reaped. This file is
# the mechanism — generic over the handle (Service request / action GoalHandle)
# and the result type — so both reuse one settlement core. The status tokens
# (`success`/`failure`, `succeeded`/`canceled`/`aborted`, `feedback`) come from
# core.jl; this layer turns a token + payload into a single authoritative write.
#
# Wiring the actual reply/result-cache delivery (Zenoh `reply` / `reply_err`,
# status publication) is the Service/Action layer's job: it constructs the cell
# with a `deliver` closure that this file invokes exactly once on first fill.

# ── the cell ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

"""
    ResultCell{H, R}

Write-once settlement slot shared by services (§8) and actions (§9). `H` is the
handle type (a service request or an action `GoalHandle`) carried so the deliver
closure can reach it; `R` is the user result type.

Filled exactly once: the first terminal write — explicit [`respond!`](@ref), the
handler's return value, or the fail-safe wrapper — wins and runs `deliver`. The
status it was filled with is observable via [`outcome`](@ref); later attempts are
ignored ([`isfilled`](@ref) guards the return-value path) except an *explicit*
second terminal `respond!`, which is the one hard error (DESIGN §respond!).

The lock makes concurrent settlement safe: a detached cleanup task can race the
fail-safe wrapper, and only one wins.

[`aborted`](@ref) — perform the *authoritative* write: the first one wins, runs
`deliver`, and latches the cell. Returns `true` if this call filled it.

An *explicit* second terminal `respond!` is the one hard error (it signals a
double-settle bug); the return-value and fail-safe paths instead go through
[`fill!`](@ref), which silently ignores an already-full cell.

dispatches it to the feedback stream before reaching settlement.

Fill the cell *only if still empty*; a no-op (returns `false`) once settled. This
is the non-authoritative path the framework uses — the return-value fallback and
the fail-safe wrapper — so a handler that already called [`respond!`](@ref) has
its return value ignored rather than triggering the double-settle error
(DESIGN: "ignored, not error").

The empty-check and the write are one atomic section under the lock, so a
return-value fill and a racing detached `respond!` can't both deliver.

"""
    settle_handler!(cell, body; success_status, default_result, log_id=nothing)

Run a user handler `body()` and guarantee `cell` is filled exactly once before
the task is reaped (DESIGN §fail-safe settlement). Collapses the three exits:

| Handler exit                         | Cell empty ⇒ filled with        | Log              |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------|
| `return payload`                     | `success_status(payload)`       | —                |
| threw `Cancelled`                    | `canceled(default_result())`    | —                |
| threw anything else                  | `aborted` `(default_result())`  | `@error` + trace |
| returned/never responded, cell empty | `aborted` `(default_result())`  | `@error`         |
| cell already full                    | — (ignored)                     | cleanup errors   |

`success_status` is the per-layer success token ([`success`](@ref) for a service,
[`succeeded`](@ref) for an action). `default_result` is a thunk producing the
typed payload for the synthesized error/cancel reply (the user result type's
zero/default). On the catch path it's wrapped so that a throwing `default_result`
can't defeat the guarantee — [`force_abort!`](@ref) is the infallible backstop.

Layered exactly as DESIGN prescribes so the guarantee holds even if recovery
itself fails: `try` settles the normal exit, `catch` synthesizes the error/cancel
outcome, and an infallible `finally` force-aborts a still-empty cell.

Returns the cell's final [`outcome`](@ref).

`default_result`, or a delivery error on the normal path).

It must not throw, so it swallows any delivery error: it latches the cell as
aborted with a `nothing` payload and lets the Service/Action `deliver` closure
recognize that as "send the status enum + zero-filled result bytes directly,
not via the message constructor" (DESIGN §force_abort!). A delivery that still
fails is logged, not raised — at that point the cell is latched and the client's
own result timeout is the remaining guard.

Block the calling task until `cell` is filled, returning `true` once it is. Parks
on the cell's settlement condition, so it wakes the *instant* `respond!`/`fill!`/
`force_abort!` latches the cell — no poll latency (§9 `get_result`).

`should_abandon()` is the cooperative bail-out, re-checked at most every `recheck`
seconds: when it returns true the wait is abandoned and `wait_settled` returns
`false`. Pass `() -> is_shutdown(ctx)` so a drain can't wedge a request task here.
`Threads.Condition` has no timed wait, so we arm a one-shot `Base.Timer` each
iteration to re-notify ourselves — that bound also self-heals any missed `notify`.
A full cell takes precedence over abandonment (matching the old poll, which
re-checked `filled` before shutdown), so a goal that settles as we drain still
replies its result.
